Project: Gaussian Blur

Navigate to src if using the terminal.
To run, use the command:
javac *.java
Then, use:
java MyImageProc

The menu File at the top contains:
Open - Opens a file chooser. Open the src folder to find a few images (.jpg).
Selecting one of them will replace the default image. (May need to resize window)
Exit - ends the program.

The buttons at the bottom contain:
Original - returns the selected image to its original form
Sharpen - performs a sharpening operation on the image
Blur - performs a blurring operation on the image
Edges - performs a detect-edge operation on the image
Custom - uses the matrix above on the image
<< - rotates the image counterclockwise
>> - rotates the image clockwise
Gaussian Blur - applies a Gaussian blur on the image. Popups will ask for 
the kernel radius (1-10) and the sigma (1.0-3.0)(Extra credit). The Gaussian kernel 
values should be normalized.

Only the File menu and the Original and Gaussian Blur buttons are really important.

The NoMachine terminal won't run the project due to how the image is read in,
but the NoMachine IntelliJ runs the project well.
