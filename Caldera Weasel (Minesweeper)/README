Navigate to src if using the terminal.
To run, use the command:
javac *.java
Then, use:
java CWeasel

If the first click is on a thermal trap, it says THERMAL TRAP HERE! at the 
bottom of the page.
It is suggested in the help section to place a flag there.

The menu at the top has a section for Settings, which includes:
Beginner - 4x4 with 5 thermal traps
Intermediate - 8x8 with 14 traps
Expert - 15x15 with 60 traps
Help - displays a popup with helpful tips
Restart - restarts the game
Quit - closes out the window and ends the program

A counter for flags left is at the bottom left, and a timer is at the top left.

A game can be won if flags are placed on all cells with thermal trap, without 
triggering a trap, and if all non-trap cells are revealed.
Triggering a trap ends the current game and reveals all thermal traps.
Any flags on tiles with thermal traps remain, while misplaced flags are X-ed out.

A resources folder is also included in the src folder. This contains the images
used for the cells.

Both the terminal and the NoMachine IntelliJ work and run well.
