My game is called Glass Maze. It is a puzzle game. The player is a marble trapped in an invisible
maze and it must find its way out. I originally was planning on including a tracing element that would
trace the path of the marble as it went over the ground; however, I decided that it made the game too easy,
and did not include it.

The Glass Maze project is made up of six scenes. The StartGame scene, the EndGame scene, the Level01 scene, the Credits scene,
the MainMenu scene, and the Tutorial scene.

The StartGame scene and the EndGame scene are very similar; both are primarily for UI purposes in starting and 
restarting the game.

MainMenu is an alternate StartGame.

Tutorial is the scene that teaches the player the goal and instructions on how to play the game. At any time during the level, the player may press the 
ESC key to pause the game and bring up the pause menu.

Level01 is the scene that contains the invisible maze. The player can roll around using the WASD and arrow keys, 
and must reach the green beacon in order to finish the game. At any time during the level, the player may press the 
ESC key to pause the game and bring up the pause menu.

Credits shows the information below:

Regarding my assets, I got all of my background images (Sky_Front, Sky_Left, and Sky_Right) from my uncle, Chadd Cole. He made them himself and I got permission
to use them from him.

The rest of the assets were obtained from the Unity Asset Store:
    The glowing materials, such as the beacon and walls, are from MK Glow (Michael Kremmel)
    The metal textures were obtained from Yughues Free Metal Materials (Nobiax/Yughues)
    The sci-fi music was obtained from the Free Game Music Collection (The Indie Devs Nation)
    All other assets (including scripts, scenes, and physics materials) were made by myself.

The puzzle solution is included in the submission.
